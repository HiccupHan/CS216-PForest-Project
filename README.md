# CS216 PForest Project
Based on the paper "p-forest: In network inference with random forests"

Download the [Network Intrusion dataset(CIC-IDS- 2017)]{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset} and place it in a data folder before running the code.

pforest.py generates three random forests using different context windows using two sets of data from the dataset, the tcam rules, and rmt inputs for the simulator. visualizer.py generates the images for the random forest and cram resource table.
